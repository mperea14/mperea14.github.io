				<h3> 1996, 2001, 2022 Stanley Cup Champions</h3>
					<p> From thier inaguration in 1995, The Colorado Avalanche have won the Stanley Cup 3-times. In 1996, they beat the Florida Panthers in 4-0 sweep after being a team for just 1 year! Though, it didn't take long to win another one in 2001 beating the New Jersey Devils in 7 games. It then took a few new coaches and players to win again this past year in 2022, beating the Tampa Bay Lightning in 6 games to regain the throne.

			<p>But where did they come from? Colorado was a growing hockey market and the city was eager for a team ever since the Colorado Rockies left in 1982. Luckily, the Quebec Nordiques were a struggling team financially and needed a bailout. The Canadian governement never gave them one and that was when COMSAT bought the Colorado Avalanche and brought them to Denver in 1995. The team had the same players, but they were a newly imagined franchise.
